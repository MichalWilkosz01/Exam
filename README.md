# Exam
This program was written in Qt using C++ to conduct exam from college subject. 

## About
Firstly user has to chose two txt files (like examples files added in repository). If the files were OK, user is able to pick the student from the list and conduct the exam to him. After students' answer to question user can pick the degree for question (the student has to answer to the red questions, green questions are extra for higher degree). After last question, on the screen will be displayed degree from exam (average degree from questions). User is able to pick the path where the exam results will be saved (in txt and html).

## How it works
If student's points >= 3.5 he can pick one of 2 drawn questions  
If student's points >= 4.5 he can pick one of 3 drawn questions  
If student's points >= 5.5 he skipps the question and got 5.0 degree
